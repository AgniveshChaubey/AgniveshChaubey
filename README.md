# Tech Enthusiast | Open-Source
I am an Electrical Engineering undergrad and a ***self taught developer***. I was exposed to technology in my 2nd year of college an by now, I am totally shifted towards Tech domain. I have understanding web development and am familiar with cloud technologies as well. I am a kind of person who prefer **collaboration** over competiotion and I love doing community work.
